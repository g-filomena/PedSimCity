## PedSimCity: An Agent-Based Model for simulating pedestrian movement in large urban areas

This model incorporates simplified cognitive maps of the urban environment in the architecture of the agents.
In particular, a computational approach to Kevyn Lynch's The Image of the City (see related paper in [Cities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275118309776)) is employed to incorporate salient urban elements in the route choice approaches of the agents. A basic conceptual model of the ABM was presented at the [2018 Agile Conference](https://agile-online.org/conference_paper/cds/agile_2018/shortpapers/64%20short_paper_64.pdf).

The introduction of different urban elements has been tested, in combination with existing route choice models:
* Landmark-based navigation: London - Methods, results and evaluation are documented in *Modelling the effect of landmarks on pedestrian dynamics*, published in [Computers, Environment and Urban Systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101573).
* Region- and barrier-based navigation: London and Paris - Methods and results, along with a validation are documented in *Perception of urban subdivisions in pedestrian movement simulation*, published in [PLoS ONE](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244099).

The role of the landmarks, barriers and region are combined and modelled together in the Empirical based Agent-Based Model.
The ABM, the qualitative study conducted to calibrate it, and its evaluation are documented in *Empirical characterisation of agentsâ€™ spatial behaviour in pedestrian movement simulation*, 
published in [Journal of Environmental Psychology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494422000524).

PedSimCity is built on:
* [JTS](https://github.com/locationtech/jts)
* [Mason](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/extensions/geomason/)
* [GeoMason-light](https://github.com/g-filomena/GeoMason-light)

Along with:
* [Apache Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi)
* [OpenCsv](http://opencsv.sourceforge.net)
* [Java Tuples](https://www.javatuples.org)
* [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org)

**How to run the applet:**
1. Install Java on your machine.
2. Download the jar file *PedSimCity1.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar* wherever it is convenient.
3. Open the command prompt in the directory where the .jar file is placed.
4. Run the command *java -jar PedSimCity1.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar*.
5. The applet should pop-up and log-messages should appear in the command prompt window.

**This is the recommended option for running PedSimCity and it does not require the user to take any other step or to manually install the dependencies.**

If the user desires to use the applet within Eclipse, for example, to explore the source files or to make changes, the following instructions should be followed:

1. Download the raw content of the Github PedSimCity Repository, as a .zip file.
2. Unzip the file and move the nested PedSimCity-Master folder wherever it is convenient. 
3. Open Eclipse, and create a new Java project; any name will do.
4. Right click on the project on the left-hand side *Package Explorer*. Select *Build Path*, *Link Source*, navigate to the PedSimCity-Master, navigate to and then select the folder *src/main/java* (without double clicking on it).
4. Import all the libraries mentioned above, manually, by right clicking on your project *Build Path*, *Add External Archives*.
5. To execute the applet, right-click on teh class ```PedSimCity.applet```, *Run as Java Application*.
6. Before pressing the *Run Simulation* button, click on *Other options* and copy-paste the entire path referring to the path *src/main/resources/* in the corresponding field. This is necessary for retrieving the input data.

The applet allows the user to run the simulating with three different configurations:
1. Testing Landmarks (London, Muenster).
2. Testing Urban Subdivisions (London, Paris, Muenster).
3. Testing Specific Route Choice Models (Muenster).
4. Empirical ABM (Muenster).

Options 1, 2 and 4 all come with pre-defined set as regards the parameters: number of ```jobs```, ```numAgents``` per scenario, ```numberTripsPerAgent```. This is line with the settings used for producing the results presented in the papers mentioned above.
When ```testingLandmarks``` and  ```testingSubdivisions```, the user can however runs the model for specific ODs by checking the ```Testing Specific ODs``` box and inputing the nodeIDs in the corresponding fields (the number of ```jobs``` won't change).
The user can also change other simulation-related parameters by clicking on the ```Other Options``` button, before starting the simulation. 

When choosing option 3., the route choice models of interest need to be chosen by clicking the ```Choose Route Choices``` button. 
The user can also define the number of ```jobs```, and ```numberTripsPerAgent``` (one route choice model = one agent).
